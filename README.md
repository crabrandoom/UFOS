# UFOS

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to build a page that scapes data from a UFO database and allows you to filter by city, country, state, shape of the UFO, and date of the sighting.

## Results

In order to use this filter you need to type in the particular data point that you want to filter by: Date, State, Country, Shape of UFO, or City, in the corresponding box. The data will then return only the sightings that match the filters used. See picture below

## Summary

One shortcoming of this webpage is that there is no button to tell it to fitler. It is possible you may need to view the original table while still filling in your desired filters.

A suggestion for improvement would be to add a filter button that completes the filtering only when the user decides - rather than automatically. Some other possible improvements would incorporate a filtering of the comment data to look for specific words that were used in the UFO sighting description.
